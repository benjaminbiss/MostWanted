# Goal

You have been contracted to build a prototype for a person search for a top-secret government project.
You have been given access to an array of objects representing individuals.
The prototype should just use window.prompt and window.alert for the User Interface (UI).
Although this isn’t typical in production, you may use only two files for this project, an HTML file and a JS file for the application.

## Technologies

- JavaScript

## Problem Solving Breakdown

## Tasks

- Before you start coding a specific user story that is highlighted in grey, you need to get with your team and write an algorithm for that user story
  - This means breaking each user story down into steps.
  - Please submit to your instructor Slack channel once completed for approval to start coding on that specific user story.
- Once you begin coding, it is important to tie tools that you have learned to those steps.
  - For example, do you need a variable to capture data? Is this a good place to use array.filter()?

**Example of a user story broken down into steps:**

- **User Story:**
  - As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the program (display values for the various traits of the found person).
- **Steps:**
  1. Take person found from application via searching by single/multiple criteria.
  2. Display found person’s attributes (first name, last name, occupation, etc.)
  3. Re-prompt user to perform a menu task

- **Technical Implementation** -- *the goal is here to constantly ask yourself how to implement this* --
  - **Specific steps into written code**  -- *“how do I display a person’s attributes?”* --
    1. Take person found from application via searching by single/multiple criteria -- turn step into code
    2. Display found person’s attributes (first name, last name, occupation, etc.) -- turn step into code
    3. Re-prompt user to perform a menu task -- turn step into code

## Highlight User Stories Task

At the end of each day, you need to send a screenshot of your user stories to your instructor Slack channel with the following highlights. The purpose of this is to constantly remain in control of your timeline as well as ensuring you remain on task with completing features of the project:

- Highlight all user stories that are currently completed in green
- Highlight all user stories that are currently in the process of being worked on in yellow
- Highlight all user stories that you have yet to start in red
